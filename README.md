Lately, I found myself reading 3 books. I noticed I experienced some difficulty keeping tab of the chapter and page I stopped in each whenever I wanted to resume reading. Hence, I decided to create a bookReader keeper that helps keep tab of the title, chapter and page I stopped in my previous reading.
